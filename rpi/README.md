# Raspberry pi

## Starting up the server

This project is intended to be run on raspberry pi with Gnu/Linux.
For development is is not a problem to run it on some other unix based os, although running it under Windows may raise some problems (not tested yet).

## Installing on target machine

> Tested only for Rpi Os

```sh
# I assume that you have ssh enabled and ethernet cable connected

# You need to have git already, to do so run:
sudo apt install git

# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/SKARPG/Toster.git
# You can also clone it on your PC and copy it
# to raspberry pi via sftp

cd Toster
sudo -Es
# Run installation scripts
sh ./scripts/installDeps.sh
sh ./scripts/setupNetworking.sh
sh ./scripts/setupServer.sh
```

## Debugging outside environment

### Requirements
- Stable or nightly build of `node.js` with `npm`.
- `python3` (for most programs)

### Setting things up

To clone the server and install npm packages:

```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Mazurel/Toster.git
# Cd into directory
cd Toster
# Download node modules
cd server && npm run build
```

If you want to mess around with loaded programs you may also want to modify `programs/index.json` 
which contains currently active programs.

### Starting the server

```sh
cd server 
node index.js
# If there is no error everything is propably working all right
```

## Adding custom program

Programs are loaded by the server (currently on startup) based on a `programs/index.json` file. 
An JSON object that is in that file is an array of objects that define every program that is avaible to launch.
An object that represent program looks currently like that:

```json
{
    "Name": "Your program",
    "Program": "python or something else",
    "Path": "your-program/test.py",
    "Static" : "your-program/static",
    "Enable" : true
}
```

Field explanation:

Name - A formal name for you program, must Unique.

Program - A Program that executes you script like `python` or `sh`.

Path - A path to script that will be executed by the `Program` field.

Static - A path to folder with static html content that will be served for the program. The folder should contain index.html file.

Enable - This field is optional, it resolves to `true` by default.

*After adding custom program, remember to restart server !*

## Managing server

Server (when installed via installation scripts) is installed into `/usr/share/toster`, everything can be found there.
For example all programs are located in `/usr/share/toster/server/programs`.

Server is managed as a systemd service. Such solution really simplifies whole server execution, for example to check status of the server you can run:

```bash
systemctl status toster
```

Or to restart it, just run:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart toster
```
