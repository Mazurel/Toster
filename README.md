# Toster

> This repo is in progress, so if you feel like something is missing fire an issue, can be in polish :)

This repo contains source code for project called "Robot Toster".
It is recommended to write in English, but everything else then code itself can be written in polish if you prefer so (it's just simpler for me to code and write in the same language).
Feel free to contribute as much as you wish.

Link to docs explaining how this project works and how to hack on it is [here](docs/docs.md).
